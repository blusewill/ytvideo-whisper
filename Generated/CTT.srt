1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Yeah, and deserves on Linux too a lot of people don't realize how much Microsoft

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,160
really does use Linux a lot now and

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,560
Yeah, it's not going anywhere. I'm hell Microsoft

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,000
I think pays a couple million a year to be on the Linux Foundation as like a gold platinum partner or whatever it's called

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,400
so

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,540
They they don't want Linux to disappear Microsoft's not anti Linux if anything

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,140
They're just trying to use it because a lot of free and open-source software projects do get used

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,620
Buy it. So yeah in free BSD

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:42,220
I'm actually making a video about like Sony PlayStation how it uses free BSD and just abuses the hell out of it

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,780
Well, I wouldn't say abuse maybe I may yeah

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,420
Because they don't really don't contribute that much for as much as they've profited off of free BSD. I

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,860
Have not seen very many commits from them. I have not seen I think most of the bug requests are more out of

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,980
Like bug reports are more out of hey, this isn't working for us kind of thing. Hey BSD team

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,980
Can you do it? I think the benefit to BSD and having like Sony use them is

15
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,700
They get a lot more eyeballs on them as a project. So a little bit there

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,900
But the main issue I have with BSD compared to Linux is Linux runs a

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,380
GPL license which means you have to keep it open source if you do make a project based on it

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,860
You have to have the code somewhere and it has to be public so people could look at it

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,860
We're BSD is an MIT license meaning you can take all their code and then write a whole bunch of proprietary

20
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,820
closed stuff and then lock it away somewhere and they never have to show the world that again much like how Sony PlayStation does

21
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,900
So it's kind of an interesting dynamic between

22
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:56,100
BSD and PlayStation which I'm gonna explore a little bit more in an upcoming video. Yeah, Microsoft's a platinum member. That's right

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,780
BSD has a license. I thought free BSD just uses MIT license, which is pretty darn open

24
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,620
At least last time I checked

25
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,780
And they it's not like Sony doesn't contribute back at all

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:18,900
It's just they don't contribute out very much at all and the last time I'm thinking back to like Sony PlayStation 3's the fat design

27
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,740
When it originally released it had a Linux

28
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,740
You could actually install Linux on it and I actually did that back in I think it was the late 2000s and

29
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,940
It was cool, but a lot of times people were using it for home brewing

30
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:39,700
I know I was and it was make it made the Sony PlayStation a lot more hackable and that's why I think they removed

31
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,300
it I think I was they even sent me like a class action lawsuit

32
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
participation and stuff and

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,080
Yeah, that was that was interesting to say the least I

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,100
Think I got like four dollars from it or three dollars

35
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,860
Anytime there's class action lawsuit involved the only people that win is the lawyers
