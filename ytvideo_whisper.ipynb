            "[08:28.720 --> 08:36.880]  beautiful. Yeah, clear Linux I heard guys who's getting discontinued. So the old Intel counterpart\n",
            "[08:36.880 --> 08:42.800]  to clear Linux, they threw their hat in the ring and they're like, never mind, we're out. And you\n",

            "[09:31.200 --> 09:38.560]  Yeah, so here's your APK tools. So cool. Oh, it didn't even have a pseudo command.\n",
            "[09:39.280 --> 09:40.400]  So you got to switch to root.\n",
            "[09:43.280 --> 09:52.000]  Distinct packages, 5000. All right. And that's a fast update on APK. We can do an APK search\n",

            "[09:59.360 --> 10:11.920]  do as, let's just see. Interesting. Anywho, yeah, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I just wanted to\n",
            "[10:11.920 --> 10:19.280]  show Alpine. I love it. It's such a cool distribution that doesn't usually get much love. Oh, okay.\n",
            "[10:19.280 --> 10:26.720]  Yeah, APK upgrade would actually update in this system. So neat. Oh, do as is already installed\n",
            "[10:26.720 --> 10:31.440]  by default. Okay, so I just needed to do as instead of pseudo. I probably create an alias\n",
            "[10:31.440 --> 10:37.760]  because I'm so used to doing pseudo. Yeah, it's such a cool distro. It does not give very much.\n",
