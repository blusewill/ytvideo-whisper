            "[03:42.420 --> 03:49.060]  So really I had to change three things to really fix this for me one alcohol was killing me\n",
            "[03:50.060 --> 03:54.780]  Alcohol is a poison who knew right don't drink alcohol, but for me\n",
            "[03:55.500 --> 03:59.540]  Absolutely no more than once a month and even that once a month. I always feel bad afterwards\n",
            "[03:59.540 --> 04:01.940]  So if you can cut out alcohol together do it\n",
            "[04:02.340 --> 04:08.060]  But definitely cut back if you're trying to be healthy otherwise yeah, you're just gonna be fat\n",
            "[04:08.060 --> 04:14.380]  I mean that's if you're 40 plus you can't be drinking alcohol on a daily basis\n",
            "[04:14.380 --> 04:17.860]  It's just there's no way to be healthy if that's you so\n",
            "[04:18.580 --> 04:25.220]  Alcohol big no no everyone knows it, but we don't like to admit it second thing added sugar\n",
            "[04:25.220 --> 04:30.820]  I would say added sugar is kind of a sneaky one because I used to eat a whole bunch of bars like you know protein\n",
            "[04:30.820 --> 04:33.940]  Bars, I'm like I'm getting my protein in I'm getting swole nom nom nom\n",
            "[04:35.460 --> 04:41.260]  But really they're just awful this chock full of sugar and usually has a whole bunch of refined carbs\n",
            "[04:41.260 --> 04:46.700]  Which is my third one and in that same realm of the refined carbs with tons of sugar\n",
            "[04:47.300 --> 04:51.700]  Cereal and all the things that we really enjoy or at least for me\n",
            "[04:51.740 --> 04:56.100]  So after I cut down on all these and limited them drastically\n",
            "[04:56.100 --> 05:00.300]  I saw a huge change in just my mood energy levels everything\n",
            "[05:00.860 --> 05:04.340]  And that's all I really have to say about nutrition. I'd say for breakfast\n",
            "[05:05.060 --> 05:07.060]  Substituting cereal for the three eggs\n",
            "[05:07.180 --> 05:11.180]  Baw game changer if I need a little extra fuel or energy\n",
            "[05:11.780 --> 05:18.300]  sometimes I'll do steel or rolled oats and cook that on the stove with just a light drizzle of honey and\n",
            "[05:18.620 --> 05:21.220]  Add in some half-and-half to make it kind of creamy\n",
            "[05:21.220 --> 05:27.180]  Oh that that also gives me a little bit if I'm going for an alternative to my traditional three eggs\n",
            "[05:27.380 --> 05:33.540]  But usually the eggs I never skimp on so that's my nutrition in a nutshell nothing too crazy there\n",
            "[05:33.540 --> 05:37.020]  I do try to get 40% protein 30% fat 30%\n",
            "[05:37.700 --> 05:43.220]  With carbs and I would say the fats and the proteins are hard to get carbs\n",
            "[05:43.220 --> 05:48.720]  You can get almost in anything but getting those were the hardest things to adjust my nutrition for\n",
            "[05:49.620 --> 05:52.300]  Using fat free stuff. I found was just complete garbage\n",
            "[05:52.700 --> 05:58.820]  Fat free stuff was just robbing me of energy and I wasn't able to hit my 30% fat content when I was just\n",
            "[05:59.180 --> 06:04.020]  Eating regular so I thought that was kind of a funny tidbit as well as I think it was in the 90s\n",
            "[06:04.020 --> 06:06.180]  Everyone was fat free everything don't do that\n",
            "[06:07.340 --> 06:09.340]  artificial sweeteners and in fat free stuff\n",
            "[06:09.980 --> 06:17.060]  Absolute garbage even though it's been thrown down our throats for the past 20 years. So as far as getting the workout now\n",
            "[06:17.940 --> 06:22.460]  Now as far as the workouts go I'm gonna start just showing one in the background here\n",
            "[06:22.460 --> 06:25.580]  This is called the light Murph. It's a 1000 meter\n",
            "[06:26.180 --> 06:31.980]  50 pull-ups 100 push-ups 150 air squats and then another thousand meters\n",
            "[06:32.500 --> 06:37.900]  And that is just a really good basis of CrossFit, which I got into however\n",
            "[06:37.900 --> 06:39.540]  I would not start out that way\n",
            "[06:39.540 --> 06:42.940]  I usually started out with walks and light jogs and then\n",
            "[06:43.060 --> 06:47.660]  Once I got in kind of okay shape where I was doing something active every day and I was like, okay\n",
            "[06:47.660 --> 06:49.660]  I really need to make a change and become healthy\n",
            "[06:49.660 --> 06:54.460]  That's when I committed to CrossFit and I just went down to CrossFit galliant\n",
            "[06:54.460 --> 06:59.460]  That's where this is actually being filmed from shout out to Drew who said I could film\n",
            "[07:00.220 --> 07:05.940]  This workout as you see me just kind of kill myself in the background here, but I\n",
            "[07:07.020 --> 07:10.700]  Really wanted to do this because that's what I wanted to do\n",
            "[07:10.700 --> 07:16.100]  I really wanted to do this because that that commitment and I knew it was challenging\n",
            "[07:16.100 --> 07:23.580]  But I also knew that CrossFit has a lot of really cool things going for it with strength and metabolic conditioning\n",
            "[07:23.700 --> 07:27.360]  It kind of gives you everything you need because a lot of times when you're older\n",
            "[07:27.420 --> 07:33.980]  You're just gonna run a whole bunch outside and bust up your knees and hurt yourself and I found with CrossFit\n",
            "[07:33.980 --> 07:36.020]  It's a good balance of everything, you know\n",
            "[07:36.500 --> 07:42.680]  The whole it's right in the name CrossFitness where you're doing, you know your cardio you got your\n",

            "[07:51.740 --> 07:56.220]  You know, there's some things about CrossFit, you know when I think about it when I first did it\n",
            "[07:56.220 --> 07:59.380]  I was like, oh my god, it's those like butterfly pull-ups and things like that\n",
